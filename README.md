# discord-report-bot
Add reports to your server but make it customisable

# This bot is maintained
You should check back for new features sometimes

# What works
As you may see some commands are not completed at the minute. You can find what works inside of completed.txt

# Legal do's and donts
Honestly I dont care what you do with the code however you are responsible if it has been modified.
